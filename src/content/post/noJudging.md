## “Everyone Will Judge Me at the Gym…”

No, they won’t.

This is the number one fear most beginners have when they step into a gym for the first time—especially in India, where gyms often feel like spaces dominated by “serious” lifters. But here’s the truth:

**Most people at the gym are too focused on their own workout to care what you're doing.**

**The big scary guys? They're some of the most disciplined people in your area, and are super supportive and chatty when you ask them for tips. This is true for 99% of people across India.**

You are not being judged. In fact, many experienced lifters *respect* beginners who are trying to improve. We’ve all been there. Day one. No clue how to use the machines. Lifting the smallest dumbbells. Feeling out of place.

And that’s totally normal.

## The Gym is the *Most* Supportive Environment (If You Let It Be)

Unlike school or work, where competition can get ugly, the gym is one of the few places where people cheer for others to win.

- When you show up consistently, people notice.
- When you hit a new personal best, someone might give you a nod or high five.
- When you're confused, ask—and chances are, someone will help.

It doesn’t matter if you’re skinny, overweight, shy, or completely lost on how to train. The gym is full of people who started just like you.

## What to Expect on Your First Day

Let’s break it down, so nothing surprises you:

### ✅ What You Need:
- A towel and water bottle
- Comfortable sportswear and shoes
- A phone or notebook to track your workout


### 🏋️ What to Do:

Start with a **simple full-body routine**:

-    5 minutes warm-up (treadmill, cycling)

 -   Bodyweight squats – 3 sets of 10

-    Push-ups (on knees if needed) – 3 sets of 8–10

-    Lat pulldown or assisted pull-ups – 3 sets of 8

-    Dumbbell shoulder press – 3 sets of 10

-    10 minutes walk or light cycling to cool down

🤝 What Might Surprise You:

 -   People may offer help if they see you struggling with form, equipment, or setup.

-    Someone might share tips or even become your regular gym buddy.

 -   You’ll feel amazing after your session—even if your muscles are sore.

*Pro Tip*: Be Consistent, Not Perfect

The biggest flex isn’t a six-pack. It’s showing up. Especially when it’s hard.

Don’t worry about the perfect workout, the best shoes, or the “right” time to join. Just get started. Make it a part of your routine. Learn as you go.

And soon, the same gym that looked scary on Day 1 will become your second home.

Desilifter Tip 💪: Try saying "Bhaiya, form theek hai?" to a regular. You’ll be surprised how fast a friendship starts. The gym isn't a battlefield—it’s a brotherhood.
